# Architecture Decisions and Trade-offs

This document outlines the key architectural decisions made during the development of the multiplayer Wordle game, including the rationales and trade-offs considered for each choice.

## 1. TypeScript for Both Client and Server

### Decision

Implemented both client and server using TypeScript-based frameworks (Vite+React for client, Node.js for server).

### Benefits

- **Shared Type Definitions**: Common types can be shared between client and server via the `shared/types` directory
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: TypeScript provides better IDE support, autocomplete, and compile-time error checking
- **Improved Maintainability**: Type safety reduces runtime errors and makes refactoring easier
- **Team Efficiency**: Developers familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript can work across the full stack

### Trade-offs

- **Learning Curve**: New developers need to understand TypeScript
- **Build Complexity**: Additional build/compilation step required

## 2. Socket.IO over REST API

### Decision

Used Socket.IO for real-time game state synchronization instead of traditional REST API calls.

### Benefits

- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate synchronization of game states between players
- **Reduced Latency**: No polling required, updates are pushed immediately
- **Connection Management**: Built-in reconnection handling and connection state management
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Server can push updates to clients without requests

### Trade-offs

- **Server Resources**: Maintains persistent connections for each client
- **Complexity**: More complex server-side state management
- **Scalability Considerations**: Need to handle WebSocket connections at scale
